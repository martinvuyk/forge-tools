# Notes on Socket

This is an attempt to design something that will be usable for any use case
where one would like to connect two machines. The base abstraction layer for all
communication protocols should be the simple BSD socket API. With some minor
additions of async where IO has no reason to block the main thread, this
implementation follows that philosophy.

#### Current plan
1. Build scaffolding for most important platforms in an extensible manner.
2. Setup a Unified socket interface that all platforms adhere to but constraint
on what is currently supported for each.
3. Make sync APIs first with async wrappers, progresively develop async infra.
    1. Make sync TCP work for Linux as a starting point.
    2. Develop sync TCP for other platforms.
    3. Start making things really async under the hood.
    4. Develop other protocols.

#### Current outlook

Current blocker: no Mojo async, no parametrizable traits.

The idea is for the Socket struct to be the overarching API for any one platform
specific socket implementation
```mojo
struct Socket[
    sock_family: SockFamily = SockFamily.AF_INET,
    sock_type: SockType = SockType.SOCK_STREAM,
    sock_protocol: SockProtocol = SockProtocol.TCP,
    sock_address: SockAddr = IPv4Addr,
    sock_platform: SockPlatform = current_sock_platform(),
](Copyable, Movable):
    """Struct for using Sockets. In the future this struct should be able to
    use any implementation that conforms to the `SocketInterface` trait, once
    traits can be parametrized. This will allow the user to implement the
    interface for whatever functionality is missing and inject the type.

    Parameters:
        sock_family: The socket family e.g. `SockFamily.AF_INET`.
        sock_type: The socket type e.g. `SockType.SOCK_STREAM`.
        sock_protocol: The socket protocol e.g. `SockProtocol.TCP`.
        sock_address: The address type for the socket.
        sock_platform: The socket platform e.g. `SockPlatform.LINUX`.
   """
   ...
```

The idea is for the interface to be generic and let each implementation
constraint at compile time what it supports and what it doesn't.

The Socket struct should be parametrizable with the implementation of the
socket interface 
```mojo
socket_impl: SocketInterface = _LinuxSocket[
    sock_family, sock_type, sock_protocol, sock_address
]
```

Where the interface for any socket implementation looks like this:
(many features are not part of the Mojo language, take it as pseudocode)
```mojo
trait SocketInterface[
    sock_family: SockFamily,
    sock_type: SockType,
    sock_protocol: SockProtocol,
    sock_address: SockAddr,
    sock_platform: SockPlatform,
](Copyable, Movable):

What this all will allow is to build higher level pythonic syntax to do servers
for any protocol and inject whatever implementation for any platform specific
use case that the user does not find in the stdlib but exists in an external
library.

Examples:

```mojo
from forge_tools.socket import Socket


async def main():
    # TODO: once we have async generators:
    # async for conn_attempt in Socket.create_server(("0.0.0.0", 8000)):
    #     conn_attempt = await server.accept()
    #     if not conn_attempt:
    #         continue
    #     conn, addr = conn_attempt.value()
    #     ...  # handle new connection

    with Socket.create_server(("0.0.0.0", 8000)) as server:
        while True:
            conn_attempt = await server.accept()
            if not conn_attempt:
                continue
            conn, addr = conn_attempt.value()
            ...  # handle new connection
```

In the future something like this should be possible:
```mojo
from collections import Optional
from multiprocessing import Pool
from forge_tools.socket import Socket, IPv4Addr


async fn handler(conn_attempt: Optional[Socket, IPv4Addr]):
    if not conn_attempt:
        return
    conn, addr = conn_attempt.value()
    ...

async def main():
    server = Socket.create_server(("0.0.0.0", 8000))
    with Pool() as pool:
        _ = await pool.map(handler, iter(server))
```

#### On future implementation of kernel async IO protocols

- Is it worth it using [io_uring](https://kernel.dk/io_uring.pdf) (Linux),
[kqueue](https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=kqueue&sektion=2) (Unix),
[IOCP](
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/i-o-completion-ports)
(Windows) ?
    - How much would we need to deviate from Python's APIs ?
    - How do we deal with external C library dependencies like [liburing](
    https://github.com/axboe/liburing) if we decide to use it ?
        - Do we wait for everything to be implemented in Mojo ? 
        ([io_uring project](https://github.com/dmitry-salin/io_uring))
- Could we just leave the implementation to the community and setup a solid
    interface?
